Most packages are installed using NuGet (see main readme.md).

The binaries of latest ScriptCS source are needed. Clone ScriptCS beside the CShell folder, build and then run the "copy-scriptcs-dlls.cmd"

NRefactory is installed from the latest build from GitHub since they update NuGet too infrequently.

The XhtmlDumper project can be found on GitHub as well.
